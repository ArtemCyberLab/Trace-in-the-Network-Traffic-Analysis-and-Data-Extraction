 Traffic Analysis and Data Extraction" is a project where I explored methods of analyzing network traffic to extract credentials. I worked with the teamwork.pcap file, which contained captured network packets, and converted it into a text format for easier processing. Using grep with regular expressions, I was able to find the email address johnny5alive@gmail.com. Then, I loaded it into CyberChef, applied the Defang URL function to sanitize the data, and analyzed the extracted information. This project demonstrated how tools like tshark, grep, and CyberChef can be used to extract valuable data from network traffic, which can be useful for both cybersecurity and studying network activity.
